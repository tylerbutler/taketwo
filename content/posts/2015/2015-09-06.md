Thank you for your prayers this past week. {{< person Robin >}}'s tests went well. The tests confirmed that eating gluten-free is helping her. The doctor has recommended that she continue with a restricted diet and treatment regimen. While it would have been nice to be able to eat freely again, Robin expected this is how it would end up. She is committed to continuing on with the special diet.

## Take Two Prayer Points:

1. Thank God that the restricted diet Robin has been following has resulted in improvements to her gastro-intestinal health.

2. Pray that the next couple of weeks when we will be on vacation on our way to the US will be restful and allow us to prepare for the rigors of furlough.

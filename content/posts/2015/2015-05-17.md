Please take two minutes daily and pray for these items.

1. Praise God that {{< person Morex >}} was able to have surgery on Thursday. Everything seemed to go well during the surgery, but today there was a setback when some of the stitches turned loose. Pray that repair will be quickly made on Monday and the healing process will proceed without further incident.

2. Pray that {{< person Samuel >}} will be able to complete his house before he needs to return to Madang with a team of checkers for the consultant check of Romans. This will make it easier for his family to cope in his absence. This is an opportunity for his extended family and the broader community to show him that they value his commitment to completing the translation work on the New Testament.

By the time we realized on Tuesday that we had allowed last Sunday to pass without sending out a Take Two, our time was in extremely short supply. Our departure was at hand and our list of tasks to do didn't seem to be getting any shorter. I continued to believe that I was going to finish my list right up until {{< person Bethaney >}} pulled up to our door at 5:45 on Friday morning to take us to the airport. I believe they call that a Delusional State!

We did manage to get on our scheduled flight. We are now in Cairns, Australia. Monday morning {{< person Robin >}} will have a follow-up with the doctor who diagnosed her with celiac disease in December. This week there will be some tests and procedures and we will get the results on Friday.

## Take Two Prayer Requests:

1. Please pray that the tests and procedures performed this week will provide the doctor with the data he needs to correctly assess Robin's condition and recommend a path forward.

2. Even though we have physically left PNG, our minds and computers are still engaged with various unfinished PNG projects and tasks. We'd love to get some of those finished up this week, especially some of the translation that I am working on.

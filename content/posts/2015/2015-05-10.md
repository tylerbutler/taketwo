Thank you for taking two minutes out of your busy day to pray for us and the {{< language Waran >}} Translation.

Update from last week regarding the tractor: The dealer is unwilling to give a quote for a new tractor. There are currently none in country and they do not yet have prices for those that are on their way. Until we are able to get an actual quotation from the dealer, the process is stalled. Please continue to pray.

## Take Two:

1. Pray that {{< person William >}} will be able to complete the process of translating the Waran text of Romans, James, and Jude back into English. This is necessary so that the translation consultant can evaluate the Waran text for accuracy and clarity and prepare for the checking session coming up in June. William is running well behind schedule in this process. Romans is almost complete but the other two books are as yet untouched.

2. Pray that surgery will soon be scheduled for repair of {{< person Morex >}}'s pressure sores. The doctors have seen him and determined that surgery is the only option but operating space and time are limited. Since critical cases always go ahead of non-critical ones like Morex.

{{< person William >}}, {{< person Bethaney >}} and interns left Likan and traveled by river to Yar Friday July 24th. They are to do village checking of the book of James during their time there.

Early Monday morning they will travel on downriver to Angoram, where the road meets the river. From there they will go overland by public transportation to Wewak and catch a commercial flight back to Madang. William will be staying in Wewak for a couple of extra days in hopes to talk to government officials concerning the airstrip.

I have heard very little from the group during their time other than they are all well. Once they get to Angoram they should be able to call me a little easier. I have been busy the past two weeks keeping up with my tasks as well as making sure the things that Bethaney normal does, get done too. You never know how much someone does until you have to do their job. :smiley:

More next week about their trip.

## Take Two Prayer Points:

1. Pray for safety as they travel by river to Angoram and road to Wewak. Pray that a public vehicle can be found quickly to take them on to Wewak. Pray for their flight to Madang on Tuesday.

2. Pray William will be able to find the right people he needs to talk to about the airstrip and for his flight to Madang on Thursday.

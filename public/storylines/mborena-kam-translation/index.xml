      <description>Samuel and the Waran checking team were not able to come in on the flight on Friday, June 5th, as we had hoped. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have contact with anyone from Yar village until Thursday morning when Samuel called. He wanted to let me know the team was ready to come in for the checking session. I told him of Friday&amp;rsquo;s flight but making that that would have meant he would have had to immediately pack up and head up to the airstrip at Likan and it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t physically possible.</description>

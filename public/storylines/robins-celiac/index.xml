      <description>Thank you for your prayers this past week. Robin&amp;rsquo;s tests went well. The tests confirmed that eating gluten-free is helping her. The doctor has recommended that she continue with a restricted diet and treatment regimen. While it would have been nice to be able to eat freely again, Robin expected this is how it would end up. She is committed to continuing on with the special diet.
Take Two Prayer Points:  Thank God that the restricted diet Robin has been following has resulted in improvements to her gastro-intestinal health.</description>

      <description>By the time we realized on Tuesday that we had allowed last Sunday to pass without sending out a Take Two, our time was in extremely short supply. Our departure was at hand and our list of tasks to do didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be getting any shorter. I continued to believe that I was going to finish my list right up until Bethaney pulled up to our door at 5:45 on Friday morning to take us to the airport.</description>

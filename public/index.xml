      <description>The Waran team arrived in Madang on Monday morning as expected. However, there was a little drama involved. At 7:15 I received a call from Likan, where the airstrip is, saying that the men had not gotten there on Sunday evening as expected. The plane had left Madang already but had 2-3 stops before it was to land in Likan. There were some nervous moments for me until around 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock when another call told me they had made it to Likan and the plane was not yet there.</description>

      <description>Another busy week is finally over. No big adventures; just a lot of daily grind. It seemed to just keep going and going! But, in the end, it is all good.
The back-translation of James is complete. Praise the Lord for that.
We have heard from Samuel. He and 4 others were to travel upriver to Likan village today. A Missionary Aviation Fellowship plane will be going tomorrow morning to pick them up.</description>

      <description>God has provided new co-workers to take on the role William has been filling in the PBTPNG Finance Office for the past four years. Even though not much time has been spent on Translation during this time in Finance, God has helped William and Samuel to make some progress. We are starting a new phase â€“ as of February 2015 our full attention has returned to the Waran Translation.</description>

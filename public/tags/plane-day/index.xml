      <description>Tuesday July 14th was a typical plane day. Rush, rush, rush. We were expecting two planes to get everyone where they needed to be. I became the designated driver to free up Bethaney to do other things before the second plane which she was to be on. William and I loaded up the cargo and two other passengers and headed for the airport. The plane was waiting on us when we got there.</description>

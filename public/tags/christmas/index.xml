      <description>Near the end of her life, one of my grandparents&amp;rsquo; neighbors told this story:
One day my grandpa came walking down the old railroad track that ran along the edge of his farm, just whistling away. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t unusual but the neighbor thought his whistle that morning sounded different, and went out to see why. When grandpa came to the corner, she asked, &amp;ldquo;Bill, why the happy tune?&amp;rdquo; He replied with a big smile, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a grandson (me)!</description>

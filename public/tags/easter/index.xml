      <description>The Sabbath day finished and on Sunday the sun wanted to come up. And Mary, the woman from Makdala village, and another Mary both went, wanting to see the corpse village. They did that and one of the Big (One)&amp;rsquo;s messengers left heaven and came down. He did that and that mother earthquake [a large quake] immediately happened. It did that and he went to the stone that was hiding the corpse hole door and rolled it away and put it to the side and sat on it.</description>

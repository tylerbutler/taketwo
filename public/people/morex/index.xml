      <description>Praise God! The Waran team was able to leave Madang as scheduled on Tuesday morning. The flight was early enough that they were able to make it all the way home that same day. Morex and Betty accompanied them so that made for an easier trip for them since they had lots of help right with them.
Each of the team members carried with them fresh copies of Romans and Jude so they could continue reading through them yet again.</description>

      <description>Praise God! We finished the checking of Romans and Jude on Tuesday. Jude went much better than expected so we didn&amp;rsquo;t need the time that the consultant had available on Wednesday. The Waran team began Wednesday to go through the book and make correction at places that the consultant recommended changes or refinements be made. We had done all the easy corrections as we went through during the checking session, but some needed more concentrated thought to resolve and were set aside for later.</description>

      <description>The Waran team has had a fruitful week. We steadily moved through the verses of Romans, to arrive at 14:19 where we will start checking again on Monday morning. Lord willing, we will be able to complete Romans on Tuesday. Seeing that we were progressing well, our consultant has prepared to check Jude when we finish Romans. Considering our late start, this is an unexpected bonus.
Another praise item this week: Morex has been declared healed and technically released from the hospital.</description>

      <description>Thank you for standing with us this week. It has been a difficult week for the whole Waran team.
Background information to help you understand: Cell phone cover is not available in Yar village, where Samuel lives. They have to hike about 20 minutes to a piece of high ground where the signal gets through. As a result, they can call out when they need to but we can&amp;rsquo;t call in when we need to.</description>

      <description>Please take two minutes daily and pray for these items.
 Praise God that Morex was able to have surgery on Thursday. Everything seemed to go well during the surgery, but today there was a setback when some of the stitches turned loose. Pray that repair will be quickly made on Monday and the healing process will proceed without further incident.
 Pray that Samuel will be able to complete his house before he needs to return to Madang with a team of checkers for the consultant check of Romans.</description>

      <description>Thank you for taking two minutes out of your busy day to pray for us and the Waran Translation.
Update from last week regarding the tractor: The dealer is unwilling to give a quote for a new tractor. There are currently none in country and they do not yet have prices for those that are on their way. Until we are able to get an actual quotation from the dealer, the process is stalled.</description>

      <description>The Waran checking team returned home on Tuesday and Morex, Samuel&amp;rsquo;s brother, returned on the flight. He is now in the hospital awaiting surgery, perhaps this week.
Konamby was one of the checking team. He is a pastor who has often been involved in several checking sessions so he has heard much of the Waran New Testament already. He also has copies of most of the books we have completed so far.</description>

      <description>John 19:37 in the NIV reads:
 and, as another scripture says, &amp;ldquo;They will look on the one they have pierced.&amp;rdquo;
 The Waran version translated back into English that had been provided to the consultant read:
 And another talk also remains like this, They will remain seeing the man who was penetrated by means of a spear.
 That is what he expected to hear from the checker when he orally translated from Waran into the Tok Pisin.</description>

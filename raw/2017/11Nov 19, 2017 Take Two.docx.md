Take Two - November 19, 2017

It has been of week of frustrations.  William is in the village of Yar
and work is underway under adverse conditions.  4-5 Keys on Samuels
computer are not working and of course they are keys that are needed for
the Waran alphabet.   William and Samuel swapped computers so that
Samuel could make changes and William could write notes as needed.  It
is easier for William to use Samuels computer with the limited keys
working.  William has 2 hard copies of the new testament with him so
they can work but not the preferred way.  There have been problems with
generators so it has been difficult to keep computers and phones (the
way William has been able to text me with limited access) charged.

Despite all of the frustration and setbacks we are thankful for the
progress being made on the Waran New Testament.  Each step gets us
closer to completing type sitting and publication.

Prayer Request:

-   Pray Samuels computer keeps working as well as it is.

-   Praise for eager participation of many in the checking, some full
    time some part time but always enough.

-   Pray the much needed work permits and visas will be approved soon.

We wish you a blessed Thanksgiving with family and friends.

William and Robin

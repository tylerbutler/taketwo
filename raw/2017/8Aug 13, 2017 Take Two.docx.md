Take Two -- August 13, 2017

Bethaney and I made the trip to Ukarumpa for our dental work. The trip
took only 5 hours because a significant amount of work had been done on
the part of the road that runs through the Ramu River valley. It was
nice to be able to travel several miles a bit faster without worrying
about hitting a bone-crunching pothole. Still making that trip twice in
three days takes a lot out of you.

Prayer Points

1.  The MAF pilot based in Madang has returned from furlough and we
    thank God for that. We have a flight booked for Friday, August 18,
    to take patients back to Likan and bring Samuel to Madang. The
    mobile network is still not working out that way so getting the
    message to Samuel so that he knows to go to Likan for the flight is
    going to be difficult. I have sent texts to all the Waran numbers I
    have in hopes that someone will get the message and pass it to
    Samuel. Please pray that somehow the message will get through.

2.  In 2007-2008 the Huisingh (high-zing) family was part of PBT, with
    Gregg and Sharon serving as teachers at Ukarumpa. We lived in the
    same triplex with them and became very good friends. This week we
    earned that learned that their 23-year-old son Caleb died in a
    hiking accident.  It was a real kick-in-the-gut moment. We cannot
    imagine the agony they are going through. Please lift up to the Lord
    Gregg and Sharon and their daughters Kristina and Erin. May the Lord
    comfort them and give them peace. May all those that Caleb touched
    in his short life be inspired by the way he lived and the example he
    set.

Blessings,

William and Robin Butler

Take Two -- March 26, 2017

The group that Max was to travel to the village with did not leave this
week. He didn't waste his time but faithfully came to work on Waran
Literacy.  Hopefully he will be able to leave this week.

Thank you for standing with us in prayer.

William and Robin

Prayer Points:

1.  Pray for Samuel as he winds up things in the village and prepares to
    come to town. The plane was originally scheduled for April 3 but due
    to circumstances that prevent MAF from making the flight that day.
    So they will do the flight on Saturday, April 1. Once Samuel is in
    town he will likely be here for 4-5 weeks so that we can make
    significant progress in preparing the text for publication. Begin
    now to pray for protection for his family while he is away and for
    things to be calm in the village. One of Satan's tactics is to cause
    sickness in families and trouble in the village to create
    distractions for workers who are in town.

2.  Pray for William to use these next 5 days very efficiently so that
    he will be as prepared as possible for Samuel's arrival. Pray for
    his health too. This past week his lower legs kept swelling up. This
    is probably just a result of sitting at the computer too much, but
    at this point, that is hard to avoid. By Friday they were getting
    painful so he spent most of Saturday lying down with his feet
    elevated. As a result his legs are back to normal now. Ask the Lord
    to protect William's legs this week.

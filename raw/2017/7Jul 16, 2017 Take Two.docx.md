**Take Two -- July 16, 2017**

Our God, You reign forever\
Our hope, our Strong Deliverer\
You are the everlasting God\
The everlasting God\
You do not faint\
You won\'t grow weary\
\
You\'re the defender of the weak\
You comfort those in need\
You lift us up on wings like eagles

As we sang this song this evening, I thought about the Mborena Kam team.
Next Wednesday, July 26, they will dedicate the New Testament in their
language. They faced numerous difficulties to finish the job. The
original missionary family was forced to leave because of health issues.
The original two Mbore translators soldiered on. Another missionary
stepped in to assist them but then he too needed to leave PNG. He
travelled back numerous times to help them complete the draft and get it
consultant checked. The entire PBT team came alongside the Mbore to
encourage and assist where we could.

When early recordings of part of the New Testament were distributed, the
hearers pointed out some grammatical errors that hadn't been noticed in
the initial translation. But listening to the oral recording made them
very plain. The team then decided to record the entire New Testament,
listen to it bit by bit, and make corrections and improvements in the
text before publishing. A team of 8 men committed the better part of two
years to that process. During the process every one of them lost a
member of their family. The enemy was working hard to discourage them,
but they knew that God was with them and was sustaining them. They
soldiered on once again and completed the job.

And joy will come next Wednesday when they introduce their people to the
book that speaks God's truth to them in their own language. What a
celebration that will be. Praise be to God, who raised them up on
eagles' wings and carried them to the finish line.

I also heard from Samuel today. He and 7 other Waran people will be
coming to the dedication to join in the celebration but also to observe.
Having been to a dedication before planning their own will be a great
advantage.

Updates:

-   The swelling on my leg was lanced on Monday. It was a lot harder to
    drain it than expected but the procedure was successful. On Friday
    the doctor said the healing was going as expected. A few more days
    and I will probably be able to go back to normal activities. Just in
    time, too, because I will be one of the drivers to take the
    international guests from Madang out to the dedication.

-   Robin arrived safely in the US and is enjoying time with her family.
    She is struggling a bit with getting good sleep as she adjust to a
    different time zone.

-   Bethaney and the interns are doing well in the village. They have
    one more week before they head to the dedication

Prayer points:

-   Pray for the Mbore people as they finalize all the preparations for
    the dedication. I imagine it's a little frantic out there. Pray that
    in the busy-ness of physical preparations, they will take time to
    reflect on the significance of the moment and prepare spiritually.

-   Pray for safety in travel for all those attending the dedication.
    There will be about 20 international visitors flying in this week.
    Then we all will be making the 4-5 hour trip up the coast to the
    village of Tambapmining where the dedication will be held. Then, of
    course, we all have to reverse the process after the dedication.

-   And, yes, please pray my leg will continue to heal without
    complications.

God Bless,

William and Robin

Take Two - November 26, 2017

May this encourage and challenge you: Every Sunday at 4 AM the Waran
women of Yar Village rise to pray. May their kind be multiplied in all
the earth!

William will work in Yar through Tuesday and travel by canoe to Likan on
Wednesday.  He will fly to Madang on Friday.

-   Praise God that the village checking of Romans went well. They
    finished Thursday and began 2 Corinthians on Friday.

-   Pray for wisdom to prevail as the community decides where & when to
    hold the dedication. They are working around other significant
    church events. Much effort will go into preparing for the event so
    it isn't an easy decision.

-   Also the mountain of things that must be done before typesetting
    begins seems to grow rather than get smaller!  It is very
    intimidating, to say the least.  We're thankful God does the
    impossible---we have a job for him to do!!

Thanks so much for your prayers.

William and Robin

A special prayer request:  My nephew Jeff True, my brother Gary\'s
oldest child was diagnosed on Tuesday with Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
Stage IV Cancer. He also has a mass on his liver that they are waiting
the biopsy pathology report to determine if it is a separate cancer or
metastatic that came through the blood stream from colorectal to the
liver.  Surgery is not an option at this point because of the size of
the masses on both the colorectal area and liver so it sounds like chemo
and radiation will begin in the very near future in hopes of reducing
the size of the masses.  Please pray for Jeff and his wife, Amy.

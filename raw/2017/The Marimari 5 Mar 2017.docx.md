**The Marimari**

It's not over 'til the fat lady sings! Or so they say.

For as long as we have been in Papua New Guinea, the Waran Churches of
Christ have ended their services by repeating together the *Marimari*.
In some services it could be a little hard to tell if the service was
over or there was just a pause before moving on to smething else. But
when a leader stood up and began to repeat the *Marimari*, you knew that
church was well and truly over.

*Marimari* is the word for grace or compassionate concern in the Tok
Pisin language that is commonly used in church services. It is the first
word in the Tok Pisin version of the following prayer:

> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
>
> the love of Father God,
>
> and the peace of the Holy Spirit
>
> be with us all.

This is an adaption of 2 Corinthians 13:14, the last verse of the book,
which in the New International Version says: *May the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you all.*

This was the very last verse of the Waran New Testament that we checked
with the consultant on Tuesday. How fitting that it should be so! Thank
you, God, for letting us know that this part of preparing the Waran New
Testament is well and truly over. The *Marimari* has been said!

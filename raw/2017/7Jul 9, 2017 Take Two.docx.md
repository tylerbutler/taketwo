Take Two -- July 9, 2017

On Monday I went to see the doctor again. After examining the bump and
the swelling in my leg, he was concerned about infection, so he put me
on an antibiotic. When I told him about our plans to go to the village
on Friday he said, \"Come and see me on Thursday.\" He also told me my
best chance of going to the village was to keep my leg elevated so I
spent the next three days with my computer on my lap and my leg
elevated. The benefit has been that I\'ve gotten a lot of work done on
organizing and revising literacy materials.\
\
On Thursday when I went to see the Doctor he quickly look at my leg and
said, \"Don\'t go!\" so that pretty much settled my future. He thinks
the knot should have gone down by now but it hasn\'t. I have any
appointment Monday afternoon for him to lance it so that it can heal.
While I will miss the novelty of this huge knot on my leg, I won\'t miss
the restrictions on my life it has caused.\
\
Bethaney and the interns did make it out to the village as expected on
Friday. Things seem to be going well for them but everyone would\'ve
preferred if I could have gone with them. If I heal quickly perhaps
I\'ll be able to join them. I would have to say it\'s a long shot but
prefer to hope that it might.\
\
This morning Robin left Madang on her way to the US. She will be
spending a few weeks with her family. This trip was planned before the
accident with my leg happened.\
\
Prayer Points:

-   Please pray for safety and good connections for Robin as she
    travels. Monday will be a very long day as she starts in Australia
    and ends in Louisville.

-   Pray there will be no complications as the doctor lances and cleans
    out my leg. Please pray for quick and uneventful healing.

-   My mother will be having back surgery on Tuesday to repair damage
    from a compression fracture. Please join us in praying for success
    for surgery quick relief from pain and rapid recovery.

-   Please also pray for Bethany and the interns. Pray that their
    experience in the village will be rich and they will gain much from
    it. Please ask God to keep them safe. The network is out in that
    part of PNG so we have minimal contact with them via satellite
    phone.

Blessings,

William and Robin

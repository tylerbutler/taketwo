                        <p>The Waran team arrived in Madang on Monday morning as expected. However, there was a little drama involved. At 7:15 I received a call from Likan, where the airstrip is, saying that the men had not gotten there on Sunday evening as expected. The plane had left Madang already but had 2-3 stops before it was to land in Likan. There were some nervous moments for me until around 8 o&#8217;clock when another call told me they had made it to Likan and the plane was not yet there. Praise the Lord!  The men landed in Madang about&nbsp;11.</p>
<p>The team had gotten a late start from their village of Yar on Sunday. The water level in the river is low because it is late in the dry season so travel took longer. When they got to the last fork in the river, it was already dark and the depth of the river above that point drops dramatically. So they wisely spent the night at the forks. They really didn&#8217;t sleep much at all that night and the trip on up to Likan involved some pulling of the canoe through water too shallow for the motor. They took the rest of Monday to rest and&nbsp;renew.</p>
<p>Paul and Muguro, who were part of the Luke session in July, returned. They are joined by Moses, who helped check Romans and John in 2014, and Shem, who has helped in village checking but is new to consultant checking. Konamby, after having been in town in the hospital for so long, chose not to return for this session. The men reported that he is continuing to make slow progress. It is really encouraging to hear that he can now move his knee&nbsp;joints.</p>
<p>In the four days that we had to work this week, we worked through 168 verses, bringing us to 1 Corinthians 8:4. That is slightly less than one-third of the 545 verses we will be checking in this session. Getting started is always difficult but the men are getting into the process and learning to work together to respond to the consultant. To be honest, it takes me a few days to get going, too. I felt like Friday was our first day with really good team dynamics that resulted in a quality check and good progress for the day. I am looking forward to what next week&nbsp;brings.</p>
<p>Thank you for praying the team into town and through our first few&nbsp;days.</p>
<h2>Prayer&nbsp;Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Continue to pray for the Waran team and our consultant Wes as we work
through 1 Corinthians and&nbsp;James.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pray for Samuel. He carries a very big load during a checking session. He
reads every verse aloud, sometimes 2-3 times. He makes corrections on the
computer (by his choice). And he also makes the major revisions that
sometimes have to be made. That means late night work. He does it all well but
it is a lot on his&nbsp;plate.</p>

                        <p>Another busy week is finally over. No big adventures; just a lot of daily grind. It seemed to just keep going and going! But, in the end, it is all&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>The back-translation of James is complete. Praise the Lord for&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>We have heard from Samuel. He and 4 others were to travel upriver to Likan village today. A Missionary Aviation Fellowship plane will be going tomorrow morning to pick them up. So there was no big drama with communications, or the lack thereof, this time. That was nice for a change. Lord willing, the checking session on 1 Corinthians will begin on&nbsp;Tuesday.</p>
<p>Frustration of the Week: Robin and I tried to help a <span class="caps">PNG</span> church leader apply online for a visa to Australia. He has been invited there to meet with two groups who assist the church in their ministry here. First, there were challenges with the internet connections, then challenges with getting all the information required to complete the application. We thought we were done on Thursday but then the list of required documentation showed up! So that assistance will spill over into tomorrow and perhaps beyond. We have been reminded to be thankful that Robin knows the <span class="caps">PNG</span> visa system and requirements so well that she can navigate through them without too much&nbsp;difficulty.</p>
<p>Kenny, whom we all have been praying for, began to experience moderately-severe pains in some of his joints this week. After a lab test, this turns out to be a side effect of one of the medicines in his <span class="caps">TB</span> regimen. The doctor told us some things he could do â diet changes and home remedies â that would help minimize the pain. Kenny has been trying that and called yesterday to say that it&#8217;s working. Robin will take him to the <span class="caps">TB</span> clinic tomorrow to see if there is an alternative for the medicine that is causing the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>Prayer&nbsp;Points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pray that the Waran men will arrive as scheduled and the checking session will get off to a new start. One of the men coming for this session has helped in several previous sessions, 2 others have helped only once previously, and one is new. Pray that we can establish good communication within the team and with the&nbsp;consultant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pray for the families of the men while they are away. Satan likes to distract the men by creating difficulties, like sickness, in their families or conflicts in the&nbsp;village.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pray that Kenny will not get discouraged by the pain or the lifestyle changes needed to minimize the pain. We don&#8217;t think he will stop the treatment but it must be a&nbsp;temptation.</p>
</li>

                        <p>God has provided new co-workers to take on the role William has been filling in
the <span class="caps">PBTPNG</span> Finance Office for the past four years. Even though not much time
has been spent on Translation during this time in Finance, God has helped
William and Samuel to make some progress. We are starting a new phase â as
of February 2015 our full attention has returned to the Waran&nbsp;Translation.</p>
<p><strong>Please rejoice with&nbsp;us.</strong></p>
<h2>Take&nbsp;Two&#8230;</h2>
<p>We live in a fast and busy world. Time seems to slip by before we know it.
Trying to fit it all in is&nbsp;hard.</p>
<h3>Two minutes to&nbsp;pray</h3>
<p>Would you be willing to &#8220;Take Two&#8221; minutes each day and pray for the Waran
Translation Team, William and Robin Butler, and the work of Pioneer Bible
Translators in Papua New&nbsp;Guinea?</p>
<p>We have had many ups and downs in our years of ministering in Papua New Guinea.
We have filled many different roles to accomplish the goal of seeing the people
of Papua New Guinea have the word of God in words they can understand. The main
language group we have worked with, the Waran, are getting closer to having the
New Testament in their hands. Samuel and William have only three small books to
review and revise and then the whole New Testament will be through that phase
of the process. A number of books still need to be checked by an independent
consultant before publication. Two major books, John and Romans, are scheduled
to be checked in April and&nbsp;June.</p>
<h3>Two major&nbsp;projects</h3>
<p>It is getting more and more difficult to get around <span class="caps">PNG</span>. Safety, even around
town, is always an issue. We are working together with our daughter Bethaney
to raise funds to buy a new 4W drive vehicle that would fit our needs in town
but would also allow us to make trips to the highlands, out the north coast
road from Madang on ministry trips, or to other towns for supplies not
available&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>The upkeep of the Tamo Airstrip at Likan is another project. This airstrip is
our main way to access the Waran area. We have received some funds from the
<span class="caps">PNG</span> Government to help keep the airstrip open but it is not enough to buy the
tractor that is needed to be able to regularly mow the grass&nbsp;airstrip.</p>
<p>We ask that you prayerfully consider giving above and beyond what you already
give to our ministry for one or both of these projects. Would you consider
&#8220;taking two&#8221; special offerings, one in the month of April and one in May to go
toward these&nbsp;projects?</p>
<h2>Take Two prayer&nbsp;requests</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A consultant from the <span class="caps">US</span> is here to check the book of John. Pray the
Waran checking team will arrive as scheduled on Wednesday April 8th.
The session will start on the&nbsp;9th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pray for William as he continues to translate the Waran book of Romans back
into English. This is needed for the consultant who plans to check that book
in&nbsp;June.</p>
</li>
